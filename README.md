Simple PoC project based on [this tutorial](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/create-a-chat-application-in-golang-with-redis-and-reactjs-c75611717f84) but rewritten from go to typescript.

``Get Started ``

First get a redis stack server running and update the .env file with your connection string. I used their hosted Redis Cloud service free tier for this.   
Install dependencies by running pnpm install, just run pnpm dev to start the development server.
